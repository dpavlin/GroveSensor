# GroveSensor
Grove Beginner Kit sensors show graphs using InfluxDB and Grafana

Very simple example how to read sensors and construct serial output
which can be sent to InfluxDB using simple shell script with just
stty and curl as dependency

Make upgrade will stop systemd service, upload new version and
start it again.
